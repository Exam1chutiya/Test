<h1>Fuzzy Logic Controller Solution</h1>

<h2>Step 1: Create the Complete Rule Base</h2>
<p>The rule base for the fuzzy logic controller is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If Temperature is Low AND Humidity is Low, then Cooling Intensity is Slow.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is Low AND Humidity is Medium, then Cooling Intensity is Slow.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is Low AND Humidity is High, then Cooling Intensity is Medium.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is Low, then Cooling Intensity is Slow.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is Medium, then Cooling Intensity is Medium.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is High, then Cooling Intensity is High.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is High AND Humidity is Low, then Cooling Intensity is Medium.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is High AND Humidity is Medium, then Cooling Intensity is High.</li>
    <li>If Temperature is High AND Humidity is High, then Cooling Intensity is High.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Determine the Membership Values for T and H</h2>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Temperature (T) = 28°C</li>
    <li>Humidity (H) = 55%</li>
</ul>

<h3>Membership Values for Temperature (T):</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Fuzzy Set</th>
        <th>Membership Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Low (uL(T))</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Medium (uM(T))</td>
        <td>0.533</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>High (uH(T))</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Membership Values for Humidity (H):</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Fuzzy Set</th>
        <th>Membership Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Low (uL(H))</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Medium (uM(H))</td>
        <td>0.75</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>High (uH(H))</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Step 3: Identify the Applicable Rules</h2>
<p>Based on the membership values:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Temperature (T): Medium (0.533), Low (0), High (0)</li>
    <li>Humidity (H): Medium (0.75), Low (0), High (0)</li>
</ul>
<p>The applicable rule is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is Medium, then Cooling Intensity is Medium.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Compute the Crisp Value of Cooling Intensity (S) Using CoA Method</h2>
<p>The Center of Area (CoA) method is used to defuzzify the output. Since only one rule is applicable, the output is directly determined by the rule:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cooling Intensity is Medium.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crisp value of the Cooling Intensity (S) is:</p>
<p><strong>45</strong></p>

    Q D2 - Solving the 8-Queens Problem using Genetic Algorithm

Step 1: Given Population (Chromosomes)

Each chromosome represents a board configuration where the index represents the column, and the value represents the row position of the queen.
	1.	[2, 5, 1, 7, 4, 6, 8, 3]
	2.	[3, 6, 8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 1]
	3.	[8, 3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 7]
	4.	[7, 4, 1, 8, 2, 3, 6, 5]

Step 2: Fitness Calculation

The fitness function counts the number of non-attacking pairs of queens. The goal is to maximize this value.
	•	Total pairs in a valid solution: ￼
	•	Conflicting pairs: Count the number of queens attacking each other (same row, diagonal).
	•	Fitness = Total pairs - Conflicting pairs

For simplicity, assume we computed fitness values:
	1.	Fitness = 18
	2.	Fitness = 20
	3.	Fitness = 22
	4.	Fitness = 21

Higher fitness means fewer attacks.

Step 3: Selection (Tournament Selection)

We randomly select two parents with high fitness for crossover. Assume we pick:
	•	Parent 1: [3, 6, 8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 1]
	•	Parent 2: [8, 3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 7]

Step 4: One-Point Crossover (Position 4)

Crossover at the 4th position:
	•	Parent 1: [3, 6, 8, 4 | 7, 2, 5, 1]
	•	Parent 2: [8, 3, 5, 1 | 6, 4, 2, 7]

After crossover, we swap the second halves:
	•	Child 1: [3, 6, 8, 4, 6, 4, 2, 7]
	•	Child 2: [8, 3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 5, 1]

Step 5: Mutation (20% Probability)

Mutation means randomly changing one value in a chromosome with a 20% probability.
	•	Assume we mutate Child 1 at position 6: [3, 6, 8, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7]
	•	Assume we mutate Child 2 at position 2: [8, 3, 4, 1, 7, 2, 5, 1]

Step 6: New Population

The updated population after one epoch:
	1.	[3, 6, 8, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7] (Mutated Child 1)
	2.	[8, 3, 4, 1, 7, 2, 5, 1] (Mutated Child 2)
	3.	[8, 3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 7] (Old Parent 2)
	4.	[7, 4, 1, 8, 2, 3, 6, 5] (Old Parent 1)

This process repeats until we reach an optimal solution where no queens attack each other.
