        Q D1-  I'll help you solve this fuzzy logic control problem step by step.

1. First, let's create the complete rule base considering all possible combinations of Temperature (Low, Medium, High) and Humidity (Low, Medium, High):

Rule Base:
- If Temperature is Low AND Humidity is Low THEN Cooling Intensity is Slow
- If Temperature is Low AND Humidity is Medium THEN Cooling Intensity is Slow
- If Temperature is Low AND Humidity is High THEN Cooling Intensity is Medium
- If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is Low THEN Cooling Intensity is Medium
- If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is Medium THEN Cooling Intensity is Medium
- If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is High THEN Cooling Intensity is Fast
- If Temperature is High AND Humidity is Low THEN Cooling Intensity is Fast
- If Temperature is High AND Humidity is Medium THEN Cooling Intensity is Fast
- If Temperature is High AND Humidity is High THEN Cooling Intensity is Fast

2. Let's calculate membership values for T = 28°C and H = 55%:

For Temperature (T = 28°C):
- Low: μL(28) = 1 - 28/25 = 0 (since T > 25)
- Medium: μM(28) = (28 - 20)/15 = 0.533 (since 20 ≤ T ≤ 35)
- High: μH(28) = 0 (since T < 45)

For Humidity (H = 55%):
- Low: μL(55) = 0 (since H > 50)
- Medium: μM(55) = (60 - 55)/20 = 0.25 (since 40 ≤ H ≤ 60)
- High: μH(55) = 0 (since H < 70)

3. Based on the membership values, only one rule is applicable (since other combinations have at least one zero membership value):

Rule: If Temperature is Medium AND Humidity is Medium THEN Cooling Intensity is Medium

Using the minimum operator for AND:
min(μM(T), μM(H)) = min(0.533, 0.25) = 0.25

4. For the Centroid of Area (CoA) method:

For Medium Cooling Intensity (truncated at 0.25):
- The membership function for Medium speed is:
μM(S) = ((S - 20)/25) for 20 ≤ S ≤ 45
μM(S) = (70 - S)/25 for 45 ≤ S ≤ 70

The formula for CoA is:
S* = ∫(S × μ(S))dS / ∫μ(S)dS

Let's solve this numerically (since the truncated function makes it complex):

The area will be truncated at μ = 0.25, and we need to:
1) Find the S values where the truncated line intersects the medium membership function
2) Calculate the centroid of this truncated area

For μ = 0.25:
When (S - 20)/25 = 0.25: S = 26.25
When (70 - S)/25 = 0.25: S = 63.75

The crisp output value S* will be approximately 45 (the center of the truncated membership function).

Therefore, the defuzzified cooling intensity value is approximately 45 units on the scale of 0-100.

This indicates a medium cooling intensity, which makes sense given the moderate temperature and humidity values provided.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
