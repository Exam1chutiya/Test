 SECTION A-

  Here are the answers to each of your questions clearly and concisely:

â¸»

Q1: List all the substrings of length 4 for the string "Manipal"

The string "Manipal" has 7 characters. Substrings of length 4 are all possible consecutive 4-character sequences:
	â€¢	Mani (positions 0â€“3)
	â€¢	anip (1â€“4)
	â€¢	nipa (2â€“5)
	â€¢	ipal (3â€“6)

âœ… Answer: Mani, anip, nipa, ipal

â¸»

Q2: List the two Finite machines with output

There are two types of Finite State Machines (FSMs) with output:
	1.	Moore Machine:
Output depends only on the current state.
ðŸ”¹ Output is associated with states.
	2.	Mealy Machine:
Output depends on the current state and the input.
ðŸ”¹ Output is associated with transitions.

âœ… Answer: Moore Machine and Mealy Machine

â¸»

Q3: Define the smallest language by stating its cardinality as the largest language is

Letâ€™s clarify:
	â€¢	Smallest language: A language with no strings.
ðŸ‘‰ Denoted as âˆ… (empty set).
ðŸ”¸ Cardinality = 0
	â€¢	Largest language over an alphabet Î£:
ðŸ‘‰ The set of all possible strings, i.e., Î£*
ðŸ”¸ This is countably infinite (âˆž)

âœ… Answer:
The smallest language is the empty set (âˆ…), with cardinality 0.

Q4: Define Pumping Lemma for CFG

The Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) is used to prove that certain languages are not context-free.

Statement:
For any context-free language L, there exists a number p (pumping length) such that for any string s \in L, with |s| \ge p, we can write
s = uvwxy
such that:
	1.	|vwx| \le p
	2.	vx \ne \varepsilon
	3.	For all i \ge 0, u v^i w x^i y \in L

âœ… Use: To disprove that a language is context-free by showing that no such decomposition exists.

Q5: List all types of Grammar used in Automata

Grammars in automata theory are classified using the Chomsky Hierarchy:

Type	Grammar Name	Language Class	Machine Equivalent
Type 0	Unrestricted Grammar	Recursively enumerable	Turing Machine
Type 1	Context-Sensitive Grammar	Context-sensitive	Linear Bounded Automaton
Type 2	Context-Free Grammar	Context-free	Pushdown Automaton
Type 3	Regular Grammar	Regular	Finite Automaton

âœ… Answer:
	â€¢	Type 0: Unrestricted
	â€¢	Type 1: Context-Sensitive
	â€¢	Type 2: Context-Free
	â€¢	Type 3: Regular
